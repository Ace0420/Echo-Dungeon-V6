Echo Dungeon: Spoken Game Guide
​Echo Dungeon is a simple, browser-based, voice-controlled dungeon crawler, built for complete accessibility. This is your guide to getting started.
​1. How to Begin
​First: Open the game file, Echo Dungeon V6.5 index.html, in a modern web browser. Chrome or Microsoft Edge are highly recommended.
​The browser will likely ask for microphone access. You must grant this access to play.
​Once loaded, the game will be silent until you tap the screen once.
​The game will speak its welcome message and prompt you to choose a class or load a saved game.
​2. Core Exploration Commands
​You can use these commands at any time when you are not in combat:
​To move: Say move north, move south, move east, or move west.
​To repeat the room description: Say look or describe.
​To check your character status: Say status or inventory.
​To interact with the environment: Say open chest or drink fountain.
​To save the game: Say save game. The game will give you a four-digit PIN to load later.
​To advance to the next level: When you find the stairs, say descend.
​3. Combat Commands
​When you enter a room with a monster, the game automatically enters combat mode. You must use one of these actions each turn:
​For a basic attack: Say attack.
​To reduce incoming damage: Say defend.
​To use your class's unique power: Say special. This costs Mana.
​To cast a known spell: Say cast spell followed by the spell name, for example, cast spell fireball.
​To heal yourself: Say use potion health or use potion mana.
​To attempt to escape the fight: Say flee.
​4. Game Updates: V6.5 Enhancements
​This version includes several key improvements:
​The Warrior class gains bonus Maximum Health on level-up starting at level five.
​The Mage class gains bonus Maximum Mana on level-up starting at level five.
​Be prepared! Two powerful new enemies, the Chaos Lord and Cosmic Horror, have been added to Dungeon Levels eight and beyond.
​A previous bug involving the Ring of Minor Mana has been fixed.
